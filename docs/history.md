# Disclaimer

This project is **not my code** I only modified it to make it more mature than it was. The original author of this awesome project is the [CodeKicker Team](http://codekicker.de/) and the original source code can be found [on CodePlex](http://bbcode.codeplex.com/).

As You can see this is a GitHub fork from [Pablissimo/CodeKicker.BBCode-Mod](https://github.com/Pablissimo/CodeKicker.BBCode-Mod) where [@Pablissimo](https://github.com/Pablissimo/) made some bug fixes and added some features.

## [@Pablissimo](https://github.com/Pablissimo/) fixed these:

- `[code]` tags no longer parse their contents as BBCode
- Better whitespace handling
- Support for spaces in tag attribute values
